With this admin panel you can do three things. 
    -  maintain the list of files which are currently using the quickstats syntax plugin, keeping it up-to-date;
    -  make specific queries based on country, ip address, and Dokuwiki page names; 
    - download the Maxmind GeoLiteCity.dat database into ''lib/plugins/quickstats/GEOIP/''; for this work you must set the ''geoip_local'' option to true in the Configuration Manager.

For the maintenance panel, click on the **Update Quickstats Cache** button.  For the Query panel, click on the **Query Data** button. 
These are toggles and will both open and close their respective windows.  The **Query Info** button will re-open the Query Info panel which 
is displayed on first opening the Query Data panel and which can be closed with a button at the bottom of the Query Info panel.  The **Download DB** button will attempt to download the Maxmind database.
