To save download time, ''quickstats'' attempts to download its table sorting scripts only if needed.  For this purpose it keeps a cache file of pages which
use the ''quickstats'' syntax  and therefore use these scripts.  This utility will prune away any files which are no longer being used for ''quickstats''.
Clicking on the 'Delete' button will save your deletions to memory; clicking on 'Confirm Deletion' will remove them from the cache.  There is no harm
in removing a page from the cache file.  If it contains ''quickstats'' syntax, it will be added to the cache file the next time the page is opened in the
editor and either previewed or changed and saved.  The change can simply be a new line.   You can also add the page to the ''sorttable_ns'' list
in the configuration editor.
