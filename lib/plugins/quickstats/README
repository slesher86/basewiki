Quickstats collects web traffic data for all Dokuwiki page requests, including geo-location, IP, page counts, browsers, operating systems, query string parameters. Its advantage for many users is that is does not require an sql database; this may limit is workability on high volume sites.  It outputs its statistics both to a Dokuwiki page and in the admin panel, which can accept detailed queries.  Complete details are found on the plugin page: http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:quickstats
