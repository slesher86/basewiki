To save download time, <code>quickstats</code> attempts to download its table sorting scripts only if needed.  For this purpose it keeps a cache file of pages which
use the <code>quickstats</code> syntax  and therefore use these scripts.  This utility will prune away any files which are no longer being used for <code>quickstats</code>.
Clicking on the &#039;Delete&#039; button will save your deletions to memory; clicking on &#039;Confirm Deletion&#039; will remove them from the cache.  There is no harm
in removing a page from the cache file.  If it contains <code>quickstats</code> syntax, it will be added to the cache file the next time the page is opened in the
editor and either previewed or changed and saved.  The change can simply be a new line.   You can also add the page to the <code>sorttable_ns</code> list
in the configuration editor.
