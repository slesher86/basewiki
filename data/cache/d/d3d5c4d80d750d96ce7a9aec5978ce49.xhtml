<p>
With this admin panel you can do three things.
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">  maintain the list of files which are currently using the quickstats syntax plugin, keeping it up-to-date;</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li">  make specific queries based on country, ip address, and Dokuwiki page names; </div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> download the Maxmind GeoLiteCity.dat database into <code>lib/plugins/quickstats/GEOIP/</code>; for this work you must set the <code>geoip_local</code> option to true in the Configuration Manager.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For the maintenance panel, click on the <strong>Update Quickstats Cache</strong> button.  For the Query panel, click on the <strong>Query Data</strong> button. 
These are toggles and will both open and close their respective windows.  The <strong>Query Info</strong> button will re-open the Query Info panel which 
is displayed on first opening the Query Data panel and which can be closed with a button at the bottom of the Query Info panel.  The <strong>Download DB</strong> button will attempt to download the Maxmind database.
